                            <dt><a name="1">Q: When and where do you meet?</a></dt>
                            <dd>A: Harmony offers services on the 1st and 3rd Sundays of every month at 8639 Columbia Road in Maineville, Ohio. Our services start at 10:00 AM and typically last about an hour. Each service is followed by a coffee hour.</dd>

							<dt><a name="2">Q: What can my kids do during the service?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Children ages 3 and older who are accustomed to a class experience (school, library story time, etc) are welcome to participate in our Religious Exploration (RE) program, which takes place during the adult service. We offer childcare for children who are not yet ready to participate in RE. Please <a href="mailto:info@harmonyuu.org">contact us</a> if you would like more information.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="3">Q: What are your services like?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Harmony's contemporary services are pretty different from the traditional "church" model. Our services include traditional Unitarian Universalist elements such as chalice lighting and sharing of our joys and sorrows, but we use contemporary music, adults are free to drink coffee/tea during the service, and each service features a popular group discussion element. Visitors have described Harmony's services are vibrant and engaging.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="4">Q: Do you have a minister?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Like many start-up Unitarian Universalist churches, Harmony does not currently employ a minister. All of our services are lay-led; members take turns choosing topics and leading the discussion each week. We also get valuable guidance from the Heartland UU District. Harmony maintains relationships with the other local UU churches and may sometimes have visiting ministers from those churches in the future.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="5">Q: What does lay-led mean?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: “Lay-led” means that our services are performed by members, not a minister. Harmony members sign up to choose topics and lead each service. When visiting Harmony, it’s a good idea to visit several times, since the service leader changes each week.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="6">Q: Is Harmony a Christian church?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Although Unitarian Universalism has Christian roots and carries some Christian traditions such as meeting on Sunday mornings, we are not a Christian church. At Harmony, you will find a mix of Humanists, Theists, Atheists, and Agnostics.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="7">Q: I’m skeptical of churches because I think they are out to make money. Why would Harmony be different?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Harmony happens to be made up of some seriously frugal members. We always try to keep our expenses as low as possible. Our end goal is not to build a Taj Mahal of a church with a two-story projection screen and stadium seating. We are budget-conscious and take financial stewardship of the church’s funds very seriously. Members are free to contribute as they see fit, and have full knowledge of how every cent is spent.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="8">Q: What should I wear?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Wear whatever makes you comfortable. When you walk through our front doors, you’ll see everything from shorts and flip-flops, to business casual to kids in pink tutus or Spiderman costumes. We care less about what you’re wearing and more about making you feel welcome.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="9">Q: How many members does Harmony have?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Harmony has 55 adult members and about as many child members. Including friends of the church, about 40 families regularly attend Harmony.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="10">Q: What is Unitarian Universalism?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Unitarian Universalism is a caring, open-minded religion that encourages seekers to find their own spiritual path. Our faith draws on many religious sources, welcoming people with different beliefs. We are united by shared values, not by creed or dogma. Our congregations are places where we gather to nurture our spirits and put our faith into action by helping to make our communities – and the world – a better place.</dd>

							<dt><a name="11">Q: What do Unitarian Universalists believe?</a></dt>
							<dd>A: Unitarian Universalism is unique in that it is a creedless religion. UU churches don’t require members to believe certain things about God, sin, or what happens after we die. Instead, our church is a community of people who support each other in the search for truth and meaning. Many UU churches use a common slogan: “One church, many paths” – Unitarian Universalist churches have members who consider themselves to be Secular Humanists, Agnostics, Atheists, Buddhists, Christians, or many others.</dd>
							
							<dt><a name="12">Q: What is the Unitarian Universalist view about God, Jesus, and the Bible?</a></dt>
							<dd>A. Some UUs believe in God, some do not, and others are not sure. We are united by our values, not our specific personal beliefs. For some Unitarian Universalists, Christianity provides insight and guidance. Many UUs consider Jesus to be one of the great teachers - someone to learn from and emulate. However, UUs typically do not believe that Jesus was the son of God or was born of a virgin. Some UU congregations use the Bible as one of many resources for readings or teachings, but at Harmony you are just as likely to hear a quote from the Buddha or Confucius as from the Bible.</dd>
