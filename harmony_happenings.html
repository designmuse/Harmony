								<dd>April 17th: “Finding Happiness in a Committed Life” by Erin Kotch
How many times have you looked back on a busy week, month or even a whole year and felt like you never did anything fun? Of course there simply isn't time when demands come from so many sources: work, kids, spouses, parents, housework, holidays… the stress can be overwhelming. We look at all these commitments and see a need take some down-time, to "veg out" in order to recharge: the remedy is obvious, and completely wrong.</dd>

								<dd>Harmony's board meets quarterly. Harmony members are welcome, but not required to attend.</dd>
								
								<dt>Sunday, April 17 from 11:30 am-1:00 pm - Practical Theology Group</dt>
								<dd>If you’d like to have informal yet intellectually satisfying conversations about theology, philosophy, spirituality, and morality, this  discussion group is for you. Discussion topics will vary, there's no homework or books to read, and no commitment required. This discussion group meets every third Sunday at Harmony, in Lakeview Room #7.</dd>
								
								<dt>Friday, April 22 at 6:30 pm - Women's Social Night</dt>
								<dd>Join us for our Women’s Social Nights on the 4th Friday of each month. Plans are in the works for our April 22 night out.</dd>
