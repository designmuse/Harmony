					<dd>"Broken Bootstraps: Why Some People Can’t Pull Themselves Up" by Julie Gebhart - It seems like the media is constantly referencing individuals with mental illness committing atrocious acts of violence, but what is the real face of mental illness? In a society where we have empathy for people with physical health conditions, why do we find it so hard to empathize with someone with a mental health condition? We will look at factors that contribute to mental illness and the stigma associated with these diagnoses. We will also examine our own beliefs, perceptions, and reactions about mental health.</dd>

					<dd>"The Unadvertised Sins of the Fashion Industry" by Kif Corcoran - The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, right behind big oil. There is a lack of understanding among consumers about the people who make our clothing, the working conditions they face, and the devastating impact on our environment. Fortunately, there are a growing number of clothing companies from which to choose that enable us to shop, while still being true to our 7 UU principles. These companies are dedicated to ethical and sustainable practices that consider both people and the planet.</dd>
