					<dt>Sunday, June 5 at 10:00 am - Sunday Service and Flower Communion<i>(Childcare Provided)</i></dt>
					<dd>"Stumbling on Happiness" by Jon King - Do you know what makes you happy? You probably think you do, but you are most likely wrong. Harvard psychology professor Dan Gilbert's work gives insight into how our minds work, and how the limitations of our imaginations may be getting in the way of our ability to know what happiness is. Sound quirky and interesting? It is!</dd>
					<dd>We will celebrate our Flower Communion during the service on June 5. Flower communion is an honored UU tradition where everyone in the congregation is asked to bring a flower. During music, each person places his or her flower in a shared vase. At the end of the service, flowers are redistributed and each person leaves with a different flower than the one they brought.</dd> This ritual symbolizes our community and the beauty each of us brings to it.</dd>
