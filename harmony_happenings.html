					<dd>"It’s in the Book: Understanding the Bible as non-dogmatic wisdom, and the expanded version of our UU principles" by Dick Galloway - Because of the ways religion has been abused, many UUs are resistant to Biblical/religious language.

					<dt>Sunday, October 16 at 10:00 am - Sunday Service <i>(Childcare Provided)</i></dt>
					<dd>"Respect" by Paul Smith - What do these four scenes have in common: 1) a Muslim man from Saudi Arabia registering for a Feminism class at a university in Illinois, 2) a deaf and mentally handicapped boy walking down the hallway at his school in tears because of his crayons, 3) a college sophomore being yelled at on the street by a stranger for not walking on the proper side of his girlfriend, and 4) an American businessman stopped midday on the busiest street in Bangkok, Thailand for talking too loud?
