					<dt>Sunday, May 15 at 10:00 am - Sunday Service <i>(Childcare Provided)</i></dt>
					<dd>"Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion" by Paul Smith - Find out why liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have such different intuitions about right and wrong, and why each side is actually right about many of its central concerns. This discussion will help you appreciate many different views of morality, and perhaps trade in some anger for understanding. Based on the book, The Righteous Mind, moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt shows that our moral intuitions originate in gut feelings (not reason) in six areas: caring, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty. Bring a pencil and paper. You’ll be asked six questions to find out where you are on each spectrum.</dd>
								
					<dt>Sunday, May 15 from 11:30 am-1:00 pm - Practical Theology Group</dt>
