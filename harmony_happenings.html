					<dt>Sunday, May 15 at 10:00 am - Sunday Service <i>(Childcare Provided)</i></dt>
					<dd>"Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion" by Paul Smith - Find out why liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have such different intuitions about right and wrong, and why each side is actually right about many of its central concerns. This discussion will help you appreciate many different views of morality, and perhaps trade in some anger for understanding. Based on the book, The Righteous Mind, moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt shows that our moral intuitions originate in gut feelings (not reason) in six areas: caring, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty. Bring a pencil and paper. You’ll be asked six questions to find out where you are on each spectrum.</dd>
								
					<dt>Sunday, May 15 from 11:30 am-1:00 pm - Practical Theology Group <i>(Childcare Provided)</i></dt>
					<dd>If you'd like to have informal yet intellectually satisfying conversations about theology, philosophy, spirituality, and morality, this discussion group is for you. We meet every third Sunday at Harmony, in Lakeview Room #7. On May 15 we’ll discuss classical ethics problems such as, "Would you fatally push someone in front of a runaway train to keep it from killing 5 other people?" to get to the heart of our own ethical values.</dd>
