                        <p>We meet at 10:00 AM on the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month for a <a href="faqs.html#5">lay-led</a> service at 8639 Columbia Road in Maineville. Our building is located on the campus of Lakeview United Church of Christ.
						Harmony's building is on the left and Lakeview's building is on the right as
						you are walking from the shared parking lot.</p>

                                here for map and directions ></a></p>

						<p>Since Harmony is a lay-led church, every service offers a unique experience. Our one-hour services typically include a thought-provoking message, small group discussions, acoustic guitar music, and coffee. We pride ourselves on offering a relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere.</p>

                        <p>While our topics change each week, some things at Harmony always stay the same. Each service begins with a UU tradition, the lighting of the chalice. We also invite our children to share their joys and sorrows with the group before they head off to their Religious Exploration classes. After that, adults also share their joys and sorrows before diving in to the week's topic.</p>

                        <p>Visitors are welcome and encouraged to participate in our Sunday services. Our Religious Exploration (RE) program is designed for children ages three and older who are accustomed to a class experience (school, library story time, etc.). There are classes for preschoolers and kindergarteners, first and second graders, and third through fifth graders. Older students attend class once per month and also attend our services, having their own age-appropriate discussion groups led by an adult moderator. Childcare is provided for children who are not yet ready to participate in RE.</p>

                        <p>We invite you to visit one of our upcoming services:</p>

                           	<dt>May 1st: "Peace – It's Not Just a Nice Idea" by Dick Galloway</dt>
                           	<dd>Peace is not pie in the sky. There is substantial historical evidence that, properly understood, peace often works while the use of force fails. Like most things, it is a matter of right practice. We'll be contrasting the view of peace as the absence of something negative – war vs. the positive presence of healing actions from scriptural, political and historical points of view, and shed light on hopeful signs in the face of today's terrorism. Yes, there are times we no choice but to fight, but not always.</dd>
                           	
                           	<dt>May 15th: "Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion" by Paul Smith</dt>
                           	<dd>Find out why liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have such different intuitions about right and wrong, and why each side is actually right about many of its central concerns. This discussion will help you appreciate many different views of morality, and perhaps trade in some anger for understanding. Based on the book, The Righteous Mind, moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt shows that our moral intuitions originate in gut feelings (not reason) in six areas: caring, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty. Bring a pencil and paper. You’ll be asked six questions to find out where you are on each spectrum.</dd>
                           
                           	<dt>June 5th: "Stumbling on Happiness" by Jon King</dt>
                           	<dd>Do you know what makes you happy? You probably think you do, but you are most likely wrong. Harvard psychology professor Dan Gilbert's work gives insight into how our minds work, and how the limitations of our imaginations may be getting in the way of our ability to know what happiness is. Sound quirky and interesting? It is!</dd>
                           	
                           	<dt>June 19th: "Applying the Golden Rule — to Yourself" by Susan Jackson</dt>
                           	<dd>Believing in "the inherent worth and dignity of every person" is a piece of cake for most of us. But how easy is it for you to practice the first UU principle on yourself? Susan will speak from experience about the struggle to fully accept and love yourself, and how you can begin treating yourself the way you believe others should be treated.</dd>
