                        <p>We meet at 10:00 AM on the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month for a <a href="faqs.html#5">lay-led</a> service at 8639 Columbia Road in Maineville. Our building is located on the campus of Lakeview United Church of Christ.
						Harmony's building is on the left and Lakeview's building is on the right as
						you are walking from the shared parking lot.</p>

                                here for map and directions ></a></p>

						<p>Since Harmony is a lay-led church, every service offers a unique experience. Our one-hour services typically include a thought-provoking message, small group discussions, acoustic guitar music, and coffee. We pride ourselves on offering a relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere.</p>

                        <p>While our topics change each week, some things at Harmony always stay the same. Each service begins with a UU tradition, the lighting of the chalice. We also invite our children to share their joys and sorrows with the group before they head off to their Religious Exploration classes. After that, adults also share their joys and sorrows before diving in to the week's topic.</p>

                        <p>Visitors are welcome and encouraged to participate in our Sunday services. Our Religious Exploration (RE) program is designed for children ages three and older who are accustomed to a class experience (school, library story time, etc.). There are classes for preschoolers and kindergarteners, first and second graders, and third through fifth graders. Older students attend class once per month and also attend our services, having their own age-appropriate discussion groups led by an adult moderator. Childcare is provided for children who are not yet ready to participate in RE.</p>

                        <p>We invite you to visit one of our upcoming services:</p>
                           <dl>						
								
								<dt>March 6th: "A Christian, a Jew, and a Buddhist Enter a Bar..." by Kif Corcoran</dt>
								<dd>In this interfaith sermon, we will revisit the ancient practice of storytelling to engage our imaginations and offer transformation when hope has grown dim. We will analyze the Christian parable of the Good Samaritan, the Jewish Midrash about Nachshon and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea, and the Buddhist parable of the Mustard Seed.</dd>
								
								<dt>March 20th: "Last Breath" by Brandie Gross</dt>
								<dd>Death is a natural and inevitable part of life. Through insights from "The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying", along with her work and personal experience, Brandie will compare and contrast how our culture views and treats death versus other cultures.</dd>
								
								<dt>April 3rd: “Stumbling on Happiness" by Jon King</dt>
								<dd>Do you know what makes you happy? You probably think you do, but you are most likely wrong. Harvard psychology professor Dan Gilbert's work gives insight into how our minds work, and how the limitations of our imaginations may be getting in the way of our ability to know what happiness is. Sound quirky and interesting? It is!</dd>
								
								<dt>April 17th: “Finding Happiness in a Committed Life” by Erin Kotch</dt>
								<dd>How many times have you looked back on a busy week, month or even a whole year and felt like you never did anything fun?  Of course there simply isn't time when demands come from so many sources: work, kids, spouses, parents, housework, holidays… the stress can be overwhelming.  We look at all these commitments and see a need take some down-time, to "veg out" in order to recharge: the remedy is obvious, and completely wrong.</dd>
