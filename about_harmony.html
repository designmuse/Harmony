                        <p>Harmony, A Unitarian Universalist Community is a fully recognized welcoming congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Association. Our goal is to provide a home for both long-time UUs and those who are new to the religion in the Northeast suburbs of Cincinnati and surrounding communities.</p>

                        <p>We are a lay-led congregation, which means that our services are performed by members, not a minister. Individual members take turns leading both the adult Sunday services and teaching the Religious Exploration classes for the children. With the exception of a paid babysitter in our nursery, we are entirely volunteer-run and rely solely on the financial support of our congregation. As of January 2015, more than 100 adults and kids are Harmony members or friends. Our members range in age from families with small children to retired and semi-retired.</p>

                        <p>As Unitarian Universalists, we support the Seven Principles of the Unitarian Universalist
                            Association. We believe:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the worth and dignity of every person;</li>
                            <li>That we should treat all people fairly and kindly;</li>
                            <li>That we should accept one another and encourage spiritual growth;</li>
                            <li>In a free and responsible search for truth and meaning;</li>
                            <li>That all people should have a say in the things that concern them;</li>
                            <li>In working to achieve peace and freedom;</li>
                            <li>And in caring for planet Earth, the home we share with all living things.</li>
                        </ul>

						<dd>Harmony was started by a group of seven Mason-area families in September of 2009. All of us noticed that the closest UU churches were about 30 minutes away from Mason and we wanted to fulfill a need closer to home. We began by holding adult services in our members' living rooms, with kids having one big RE class in the basement. Since the start of 2010, Harmony has had four public meeting spaces. Each time we've moved, we've quickly outgrown the new space! We moved to our current home at 8639 Columbia Road in Maineville in July of 2013. Harmony became a fully-recognized member of the Unitarian Universalist Association in June of 2011 and earned Welcoming Congregation status in 2012. What started as seven families meeting in homes has now grown into a community of more than 100 people!</dd>

                        <p>Harmony is an open and welcoming religious
                            community, embarking together on an intellectual and spiritual search for truth and
                            meaning. We walk together with compassion for our Earth, our families, our communities
                            and each other, sharing the delight of our joys and the burden of our sorrows, and
                            promoting peace and justice.</p>
